        <h2 style="text-align: center;">About</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center; width: 70%;"> My name is Eric Tran, and I am a intended Computer Science major in the college of L&S at the University of California Berkeley. I have recently just tranfered to my current school, and I have loved being in the Bay Area so far. I was born and raised in Orange County where it is often hot and spread out like any typical suburb, but moving to the Bay has introduced to me a myriad of experiences and cultures that you wouldn't find back in OC. Of course I do miss living in OC where the majority of my friends and family are, but I am glad to have found new family and friends here, and I look forward to the next two years of my life here in the city of Berkeley. Go Bears! </p>

          <p class="work_description">I created a website last year for my parents' small business! My parents run a small bakery / bagel shop in Buena Park, California. I mainly used the Odin Project to self teach myself the foundational knowledge of front end development. I only ever completed the HTML and CSS portion of the online course, thus the website was build completely on HTML and CSS only with no JS. Here is a link to the website! <a href="https://freshbagelsandcafe.com/" target="_blank">Link ;)</a></p>
          <p class="work_description">During highschool, I have had extensive involvement in the Red Cross Club of my school. I was secretary in my junior year and moved on to president during my senior year. We worked extensively with Negu, Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange County, and Surfrider to volunteer the club's time and energy towards their mission and to give back to our immediate surrounding community of Orange County! Additioanlly, we held fundraisers throughout the year to fund our school's ermegency supplies in case of various environemntal disasters or threats, and we held a school-wide toy drive every year to spread the festivities and joy to our community.</p>
          <p class="work_description">I have almost four years of work experience at my parent's small bakery! I have managed a small team in working the front of the shop where we sold our baked goods and bagels! I have exntensive experience with customer service and am knowledgable on how to handle the team when it gets busy or stressful. Additionally, I am able to bake various goods, and I am able to make various different bagels from scratch! Lastly, I run/manage the online portion of the business, and I am very knowledgable of the resources the two delivery services offer to small businesses like us. The online portion has been up and running for almost half a year now and continues to grow rapidly day by day!</p>
